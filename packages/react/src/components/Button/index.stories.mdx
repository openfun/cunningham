# Button

The Cunningham Button behaves the same as the native html `<button>` element, but with a few extra features.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-button--primary"/>
  <Story id="components-button--secondary"/>
  <Story id="components-button--tertiary"/>
  <Story id="components-button--danger"/>
</Canvas>

<Source
  language='ts'
  dark
  format={false}
  code={`import { Button } from "@openfun/cunningham-react";`}
/>

## Icons

You can use icons within the button by passing the icon name as a prop.

> Use the attribute `iconPosition` to position the icon on the left or right side of the button. The default is `left`.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="components-button--icon-left"/>
</Canvas>

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="components-button--icon-right"/>
</Canvas>

## Disabled

The button can be disabled. The disabled button will render the same no matter what color is used.

> Keep in the mind that a disabled button will never call `onClick` if it is provided.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story id="components-button--disabled"/>
</Canvas>

## Props

You can use all the props of the native html `<button>` element props plus the following.

<ArgsTable of={Button} />



## Design tokens

Here a the custom design tokens defined by the button.

| Token        	| Description                 	|
|---------------	|-----------------------------	|
| border-radius 	| Border radius of the button 	|
| height        	| Height of the button        	|
| font-size     	| Font size of the label      	|
| font-weight   	| Font weight of the label    	|

## Do's and don'ts

### Never use two "filled buttons" or "primary buttons" on the same page for two main actions.

The primary button designates the user's primary action, it is highlighted here with a primary color.
The primary button should not be used for a secondary action.

### Size of icons in a primary MD button

When you go to change the icon in the properties by browsing the icon library, you must choose only icons a size of 24x24px
to respect the size of the container

### Good practice for primary, secondary and tertiary button

For a good practice we use only one primary button per page to define the main action with 1/3 of secondary buttons and as
many tertiary buttons as needed.

### Exceptional red button for delete

Secondary button to be used when important non-reversible action surrounded by red.
