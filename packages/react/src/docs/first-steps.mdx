# Rendering your first component

Now that you have completed the [Installation](?path=/docs/getting-started-installation--docs) it's time to render our first component!

> You can find a fully working example [here](https://github.com/openfun/cunningham/blob/main/apps/demo/src/App.tsx) in the demo app.

Let's create an `App` component that will render a `Button`.

<Source dark={true} code={`

import {
  Button,
  CunninghamProvider
} from "@openfun/cunningham-react";

export const MyApp = () => {
  return (
    <CunninghamProvider>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('hello world!')}>Click me!</Button>
    </CunninghamProvider>
  );
};

`}></Source>


As you can see we nest our component inside `CunninghamProvider`, as a rule of thumb you always need to put Cunningham's components
inside `CunninghamProvider` or they will not work. You only need to use one `CunninghamProvider`, for example at the root of your app.

And voilÃ ! You're done ðŸ¥³
